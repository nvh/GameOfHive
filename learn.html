      </a>Honeybee Mass Extinction</h3>

    <p>Perhaps the biggest foreboding danger of all facing humans is the loss of the global honeybee population. The consequence
      of a dying bee population impacts man at the highest levels on our food chain, posing an enormously grave threat to
      human survival. Since no other single animal species plays a more significant role in producing the fruits and vegetables
      that we humans commonly take for granted yet require near daily to stay alive, the greatest modern scientist Albert
      Einstein once prophetically remarked, “Mankind will not survive the honeybees’ disappearance for more than five years.”
